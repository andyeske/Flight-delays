# Quantifying and Exploring Flight Delay Trends in the U.S. Airline Industry

In this repository, we provide an overview of the MATLAB script utilized to:
1) Compute the flight delay matrices featured in our work: P (probability), D (delay), E (expected delay) and S (stationary distribution).
2) Modify the code to obtain route-specific flight delay information.
